Task 1:
Implement a method to perform a basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If the “compressed” string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string.

Task 2:
A child is running up a staircase with n steps, and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.
